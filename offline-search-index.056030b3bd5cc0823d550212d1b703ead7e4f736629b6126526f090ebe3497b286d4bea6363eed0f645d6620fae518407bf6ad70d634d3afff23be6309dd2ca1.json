[{"body":"Modwatch for Vortex is an unofficial extension for the Vortex mod manager that adds support for building and uploading modlists based on your installed mods. This will allow you to upload modlists to modwat.ch directly from Vortex. To clarify, this project is not affiliated in any way with Nexus Mods or anyone else, and is an open-source community resource.\nStatus and Limitations Modwatch for Vortex is still alpha-quality software! While I can test locally, I won't be able to cover every case and there is a high potential for bugs that haven't been found yet. Equally, this project is still in its infancy so there will likely be quite a few changes to how we do things.\nThat said the core functionality of generating and uploading modlists should be working and can be used to immediately create and publish your modlist to Modwatch.\nIf you're really missing specific features you can open an issue and we can discuss the viability, or find me on the Nexus Mods Discord.\nVortex Showcase Because pulling this stuff is surprisingly hard, Modwatch for Vortex is actually an extension of another Vortex extension: Vortex Showcase. Vortex will automatically prompt you to install Showcase if you don't have it, but this extension uses Showcase to handle the high-level stuff of building the modlist.\nPurpose To be clear about this: this extension (just like Showcase) is not intended as a backup solution, or anything else like that. We cover this in the FAQ, but this is simply a way of publishing your modlists from within Vortex.\n","excerpt":"Modwatch for Vortex is an unofficial extension for the Vortex mod …","ref":"/docs/introduction/","title":"Introduction"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with Modwatch for Vortex specifically. For help with Vortex itself, check out the Vortex Support page.\n Welcome to the User Guide for the Vortex Modwatch project! Navigate the documentation using the links on the sidebar.\nDocumentation for how to get started with the extension, as well as how to start creating your own showcases is available. Remember, these docs are also open-source and contributions are always welcome!\n","excerpt":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with Modwatch …","ref":"/docs/","title":"Documentation"},{"body":"Below is a collection of frequent questions and the best answers I can give.\nWhy do I need Vortex for this? You don't! This extension is specifically for people already using Vortex to manage your mods who want an easier way to share their mod setups. If you're currently using the Modwatch Uploader, you can continue to do so if you want!\nDoesn't Modwatch have an uploader? Yes, and you can use that if you like! However, it doesn't have support for Vortex so your modlists will only include plugins, and only if you mess around with which folder you point it to. Using Modwatch for Vortex lets you upload your modlist directly from Vortex with a minimum of hassle.\nWhat games can I use this with? Currently, the extension will only create reports for Skyrim, Skyrim SE and Fallout 4.\nWhat's included in the mod list? The modlists we upload will include two things: a list of all the enabled (and/or native) plugin files for the current game, and the names of every enabled mod in the current profile. You can also use the normal Showcase extension to create a modlist using only certain mods!\nWhy does Vortex say I need to install another extension? Because pulling this stuff is surprisingly hard, Modwatch for Vortex is actually an extension of another Vortex extension: Vortex Showcase. Vortex will automatically prompt you to install Showcase if you don't have it, but this extension uses Showcase to handle the high-level stuff of building the modlist.\n","excerpt":"Below is a collection of frequent questions and the best answers I can …","ref":"/docs/introduction/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"body":"Installing the Extension To create and upload, you'll need to install the extension into Vortex first. There's a couple of different ways to do that, but unless you've got a pretty specific use case, you'll probably want one of the two automatic methods, but manual installation is available as well.\nAutomatic Installation  This is the easiest way to install!\n  Open up Vortex, and open the Extensions panel from the left sidebar. Click Find more to open the list of Extensions Find Modwatch for Vortex and click Install Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  If you don't already have Vortex Showcase installed, Vortex will also prompt you to install this and you'll need to restart Vortex again.\nOnce Vortex has restarted, switch back to your Mods screen and you should be ready to create a showcase!\nSemi-Automatic Installation If you can't install directly from the Extensions screen, you can instead install from the archive.\n Download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub Open the Extensions panel in Vortex Click on the Drop File(s) box in the corner and locate the archive you downloaded. Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, switch back to your Mods screen and you should be ready to create a showcase!\nManual Installation  Only attempt this if you absolutely have to. It becomes much harder to debug and much harder to upgrade.\n If you want to install the extension yourself, you will have to install the actual extension files manually. Make sure you close Vortex before proceeding.\nFirst, download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub.\nNext, unpack the archive to somewhere convenient. You should have a directory named vortex-modwatch with a handful of files inside, including at least the following:\n info.json index.js  Now, copy the whole directory to your Vortex folder. You can easily open your Vortex folder by opening a new File Explorer window and entering the following in to the location bar: %APPDATA%/Vortex and then opening the plugins directory (create it if it doesn’t exist).\nOnce you’re done, you should have files at the following location:\nC:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\vortex-modwatch\\info.json C:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\vortex-modwatch\\index.js C:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\vortex-modwatch\\\u003csome-other-files\u003e... With those files in place, you're clear to start Vortex and you should see the actions in your Mods screen.\n","excerpt":"Installing the Extension To create and upload, you'll need to install …","ref":"/docs/usage/installation/","title":"Installation"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with the extension and creating showcases with Vortex.

Just click that button to immediately start building a report using all of your currently enabled mods. You will be prompted for an optional title, which will be included in the “tag” of your uploaded modlist.\nOnce the list has been built, you'll be prompted to enter your username and password for modwat.ch. If you have an existing account, make sure you enter the correct password, or enter a new username/password to create an account. Once you've done that, your modlist will be automatically uploaded to modwat.ch and you will see a notification where you can view your new list.\nSelected Mods Since we're using Vortex Showcase under the covers, you can also upload modlists with only some mods. Select multiple mods in your Mods list and then click the Create Showcase button at the bottom of the Mods list. Optionally, enter a title and make sure to choose the Modwat.ch format when prompted. One the showcase has been generated, you should see a notification with a Publish button. Click that (and enter your username/password when prompted) to immediately upload a modlist using just the mods you had selected.\n","excerpt":"There's two ways to upload a modlist, depending on whether you want to …","ref":"/docs/usage/report/","title":"Create and Upload your Mod list"},{"body":" The latest version of the extension is always available on Nexus Mods.\n 0.0.2  Hotfix to Initial Release\n This release fixes a minor bug that was preventing enabled DLC plugins from being included in showcases for FO4 and SLE.\nThis version requires Vortex 1.3+ and Vortex Showcase 0.1+.\n0.0.1  Initial Release\n This initial release adds the core feature of building and uploading modlists to Modwatch/modwat.ch.\nThis version requires Vortex 1.3+ and Vortex Showcase 0.1+.\nIn general terms, you need to install the extension, then create and upload your list!\n","excerpt":" The latest version of the extension is always available on Nexus …","ref":"/docs/usage/changelog/","title":"Changelog"},{"body":"  #td-cover-block-0 { background-image: url(/background_hu30910665284931ace4f57faa1e01d828_120092_960x540_fill_q75_catmullrom_top.jpg); } @media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) { #td-cover-block-0 { background-image: url(/background_hu30910665284931ace4f57faa1e01d828_120092_1920x1080_fill_q75_catmullrom_top.jpg); } }  Modwatch for Vortex Documentation   GitHub   Nexus Mods   Upload and share your modlists directly to Modwatch from Vortex.
