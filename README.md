# Modwatch for Vortex

An experimental extension for Vortex (and Vortex Showcase) to generate and upload mod lists to modwat.ch.

**Important**: This extension has not been tested *at all* outside of my own super janky setup.

> This extension is highly experimental and almost certainly still has a lot of bugs. Proceed at your own risk.

## How to use it?

You can install the extension from the CI builds (click the Actions tab above). Restart Vortex and you should be good to go.

> Please report any bugs or issues you find as I have only been able to complete some basic (and limited) testing with this extension.
